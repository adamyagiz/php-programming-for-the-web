Final Project

You will create a PHP Web application that incorporates what you've learned 
throughout the course. The application must do at least three of the 
following:

    registers users and allows them to log in
    
    dynamically generates pages based upon HTML templates
    
    uses cookies, sessions, and/or authentication
    
    involves image, Shockwave, or PDF creation
    
    handles file uploads
    
    logically incorporates regular expressions, user-defined functions, or 
      include()
    
    uses object-oriented programming
    
    utilizes databases, directories, or files

Possible, real-world applications are (you are not limited to any of the 
following):

    shopping cart
    
    message forum (similar to the discussion forums)
    
    online email system (send and receive using IMAP)
    
    search engine
    
    Whois check
    
    schedulable calendar
    
    PHP-based chat rooms

HTML design quality will not be a factor in the project grade, but you must 
demonstrate: solid programming skills; adequate documentation within the code; 
efficiency; security; understanding of related technologies (databases, LDAP, 
and so on); and long-range thinking (room for the site to grow and be easily 
modified).
