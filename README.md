# PHP Programming for the Web

PHP Programming for the Web was an online course taken through the US Berkeley Extension program. This was my final project for the class; a simple take on an online profile matching service.

## What's Here

The app allows a user to sign up, enter basic profile information, including upload a profile image, and answer some simple like/don't-like questions.

Based on the answers provided, the app does some basic calculations and determines a best match.
